/*
Conway's Game of Life is a great exercise in understanding cellular automata,
arrays, and control flow in C.
it's important for you to learn and understand the concepts yourself.
 Here are some steps to get you started:

Create a 2D array to represent the game board.
Each cell can be a boolean or integer representing whether a cell is alive or dead.
Initialize the board with some pattern of live cells.
Write a function to calculate the number of live neighbors for each cell.
Write a function to update the board for the next generation. ]
According to the rules of the game, a live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive,
a dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive,
and all other cells will be dead in the next generation.
Write a loop to continuously update the board and perhaps print it out to see the progress of the game.
Remember to break down the problem into smaller tasks and tackle each one at a time.
Good luck!
