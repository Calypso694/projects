SQL is more difficult than i thought on first real attempts with this problem.
Its language is far simpler to read than the others tackled so far but for me
the understaning isnt quite there yet.

i should note i didnt download or pull up the downloadable app that is meant
for SQL to show the date tables so that could have been a problem here for me
in making it more difficult than it should have been.

more practice obviiously will fix these issues but i find SQL incredibly boring
in my opinion and i cant imagine having a job that searches through databases the entire
day but again, it could just be my light grasp on the language.

so far not a fan. we shall see what the other problems bring i suppose.

in regards to the actual SQL questions it wasnt  difficult to understand what
they were asking and i can see how it does help with data collection.
its almost like filtering out songs for the radio or doing a quick search for X or Y
song to find and how it could make that easier.

the beginning of 1 through 3 i liked or finding the averages was fine but something
about Nesting through me off. With the way SQL is handled it feels difficult to
write it out and feel right about it.
i also found significant issue with not being able to run .exit or other commands
easily and had to close down the terminal multiple times.

hopefully the other problems are easier than this.
